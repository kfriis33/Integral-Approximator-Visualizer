# Integral-Approximator-Visualizer
This project displays a coordinate plan in which the user can draw a line with their mouse. Then, they select a radio button for how the would like the integral under the line they drew to be approximated (options are various Riemann sums). The program calculates the integral using the selected method, and displays the rectangles approximating it. Pillow must be installed in order for the python file to run.
